# Gradient Descent
# Your task is to minimize the function via Gradient Descent: 

#f(x) = x^2

# Gradient Descent is an optimization technique widely used in machine learning for training models. It is crucial for minimizing the cost or loss function and finding the optimal parameters of a model.

# For the above function the minimizer is clearly x = 0, but you must implement an iterative approximation algorithm, through gradient descent.

# Input:

# iterations - the number of iterations to perform gradient descent. iterations >= 0.
# learning_rate - the learning rate for gradient descent. 1 > learning_rate > 0.
# init - the initial guess for the minimizer. init != 0.
# Given the number of iterations to perform gradient descent, the learning rate, and an initial guess, return the value of x that globally minimizes this function.

# Round your final result to 5 decimal places using Python's round() function.
class Solution:
    def get_minimizer(self, iterations: int, learning_rate: float, init: int) -> float:
        
        weight = init;
        # df_dx = 
        for _ in range(iterations):
            
            weight = weight - learning_rate * (2 * weight)


        return round(weight, 5);
